##  Technical Focus & Core Projects

### HORUS – Unified Operational Supervisor (SDIS)
An on-premise, web-first platform consolidating real-time dashboards, mapping, predictive analytics, and secure alerts—all within your infrastructure. Built on a microservices architecture with Kotlin/Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, jsreport, Angular front-end (CoreUI, ag-Grid, ag-Charts, Google Maps), and observability via Prometheus/Grafana. The platform also features AI for event detection and alert automation.

### PSO – Operational Supervision Portal
An earlier version of HORUS leveraging modern development technologies like Spring Boot to unified disparate rescue service software tools into a single operational interface.

### First Aid Training (VR)
A virtual reality application for teaching emergency response techniques (CPR, recovery position, situational analysis) in an immersive, interactive environment. Demonstrates your expertise in VR serious gaming and pedagogical design.

### Odyssée – Hyper-Reality Travel
A VR-based storytelling project for the Bibliothèque Humaniste de Sélestat, allowing users to “travel” through historical narratives drawn from library manuscripts across different virtual worlds.

### Vaux – Historical VR Exploration
A mobile AR/VR app enabling users to virtually explore the ruins of Vaux-devant-Damloup, a WWI destroyed village. Features GPS, compass, and compass-driven navigation in a historical 3D reconstruction environment.

### Dojo of Villebon-Sur-Yvette – Architectural Visualization
An ArchViz project transforming CAD models into high-fidelity real-time interactive scenes. Focused on mesh optimization, material design, and immersive presentation techniques.

##  UE4 Plugins & Tools

We develop a rich ecosystem of Unreal Engine plugins aimed at enhancing development flexibility and realism:

- **Landscape Generator**: Procedural terrain generator using Perlin/Voronoi noise, material layering, tiled landscapes, and seeded foliage spawning.
- **Shapefile Reader**: Imports GIS shapefiles into UE4 as splines—for traffic simulation or urban modeling.
- **Android Sensors API**: Blueprint-accessible plugins to leverage Android device sensors (e.g. light sensor, SMS) via JNI bridging.
- Plus additional plugins: Unreal Web Server, UMG Video Player, Noise Library, Filter Toolkit, Productivity Tools, Windows Message Box, NMEA Parser.

These tools reflect deep expertise in multi-platform C++/Blueprint development, editor integration, performance optimization (such as ParallelFor, asset registry handling, UI widgets), and modern Unreal Engine development patterns.

##  Research & Innovation (CIAD Affiliation)

Our team is closely affiliated with the **CIAD Lab**, fostering research into distributed AI, multi-agent coordination, policy-based systems, and intelligent data interpretation. This affiliation enhances our ability to embed advanced prediction, automation, and decision-support systems within platforms like HORUS.
